    <p id=abm>
        As a dedicated and highly motivated Computer Science student, 
        I have developed a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and software development through both academic coursework and hands-on projects. 
        I am passionate about designing efficient, scalable, 
        and innovative technical solutions that solve real-world problems. 
        With a keen interest in staying at the forefront of emerging technologies, 
        I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to dynamic projects in the tech industry. 
        Currently seeking an internship or entry-level position where I can apply my academic training in a practical setting, 
        further hone my technical abilities, and gain valuable industry experience while working alongside experienced professionals. 
        I am committed to continuous learning and growth, 
        with a strong desire to make meaningful contributions to teams and projects that drive technological advancement.
